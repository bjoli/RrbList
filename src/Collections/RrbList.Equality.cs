 *         <see cref="EqualityComparer{T}.Default" /> falls back to — so a list used as a
 *         dictionary key never finds its own entry, and one built twice from the same
 *         elements compares unequal.
 *     </para>
 *     <para>
 *         Elements are compared and hashed through <see cref="EqualityComparer{T}.Default" />,
 *         so equality is structural exactly as deep as the elements' own is.
